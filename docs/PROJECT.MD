Thought about Group Training CRM components for 7 seconds
Brief Thought Process
A Group Training Organisation (GTO) and labour hire CRM must accommodate candidate management, client management, compliance and training records, job placements, timesheets, and reporting. The wireframe should reflect the entire candidate-to-placement life cycle, client communications, and compliance documentation, while also incorporating finance and reporting dashboards.

Chosen Approach
The approach is to detail the main screens and components of the CRM in a hierarchical manner, mapping key entities (candidates, clients, placements, timesheets, training modules) to their respective pages and sub-functions. Additionally, we will list out the functionality of each component and outline user flows.
