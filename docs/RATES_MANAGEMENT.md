# Rates Management System

## Overview

The Rates Management System is a core component of our CRM platform, responsible for handling all aspects of employee rates, awards, and compliance with Fair Work regulations.

## Current Implementation

### Fair Work API Integration

- Implemented a robust Fair Work API client with:
  - Type-safe request/response handling
  - Automatic retries and timeout management
  - Environment-specific configuration (sandbox/production)
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Caching System

- Integrated Redis-based caching for:
  - Active awards
  - Award classifications
  - Rate templates
  - Classification hierarchies
- Configurable TTL and cache invalidation

### Core Services

1. **FairWork Service**
   - Award management and retrieval
   - Rate validation against Fair Work standards
   - Classification hierarchy management
   - Rate template handling
   - Real-time rate calculations

2. **Cache Service**
   - Redis integration
   - Type-safe cache operations
   - Automatic serialization/deserialization
   - Error resilience

### Type System

- Comprehensive TypeScript types for:
  - Awards and classifications
  - Rate templates and calculations
  - API requests and responses
  - Error handling

## Planned Implementation

### 1. Agreement Parser Service

- ML-based parsing of employment agreements
- Features:
  - Automatic extraction of rates and conditions
  - Classification matching
  - Validation against Fair Work standards
  - Historical rate tracking
- Technical Stack:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text extraction
  - Machine Learning for pattern recognition
  - Rule-based validation engine

### 2. Calculation Engine Service

- Rule-based calculation engine for:
  - Base rates
  - Penalties and allowances
  - Award conditions
  - Historical rate calculations
- Features:
  - Dynamic rule configuration
  - Audit logging
  - Compliance validation
  - Rate simulation

### 3. Validation System

- Comprehensive validation against:
  - Fair Work standards
  - Award conditions
  - Enterprise agreements
  - Industry standards
- Features:
  - Real-time validation
  - Compliance reporting
  - Audit trail
  - Alert system for non-compliance

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all services
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Performance testing for caching
- Load testing for concurrent operations
- Compliance validation tests

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Performance metrics tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- API response times
- Compliance audit logs

## Security Considerations

- API key management
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption
- Access control
- Audit logging

## Future Enhancements (Q3-Q4 2025)
