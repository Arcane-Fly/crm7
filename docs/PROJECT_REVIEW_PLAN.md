  - Comprehensive logging and monitoring using Sentry and custom logger utilities.
  - CI/CD pipelines running linting, type-checking, and full test suites on every commit.

## 6. Performance Optimization
- **Frontend Optimization:**  
  - Code splitting, lazy loading, and image optimization using Next.js features.
  - Efficient data handling with React Query and aggressive caching strategies.
- **Backend Optimization:**  
  - Performance tuning in Supabase, including optimized queries and real-time data subscriptions.
  - Use of serverless Edge Functions for reduced latency.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Real-time performance tracking with Sentry, custom spans, and Web Vitals.
  - Regular performance audits to ensure optimal load times and resource usage.

## 7. Security Implementation
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - Robust user authentication (email/password, MFA) and session management.
  - Role-based access control enforced via middleware (e.g., withAuth).
- **Data Protection:**  
  - Encryption at rest and in transit using HTTPS and proper encryption algorithms.
  - Regular security audits, dependency vulnerability scanning, and adherence to security best practices.
