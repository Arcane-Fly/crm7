# System Architecture Overview

## Core Systems Architecture

This document consolidates the architectural approaches from all project versions (crm3, crm4, crm5, crm7) into a unified architecture.

### Key Components

1. Frontend Architecture
   - Next.js 14 with App Router
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
   - Zustand for state management
   - React Query for data fetching

2. Backend Services
   - Supabase for database and auth
   - Vercel Blob for file storage
   - Redis for caching (planned)
   - WebSocket for real-time features

3. Integration Layer
   - Fair Work API integration
   - Government portal connectors
   - RTO/TAFE system integration
   - Financial system connectors

4. Core Features
   - Apprentice management
   - Training & compliance
   - Payroll & funding
   - Reporting & analytics
   - Document management

### System Interactions

1. User Interface Layer
   - Responsive web interface
   - Progressive web app capabilities
   - Real-time updates
   - Offline support (planned)

2. Business Logic Layer
